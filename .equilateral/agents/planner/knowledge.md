# Planner Agent Knowledge Base

**Agent Type**: Strategic Task Breakdown Specialist  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-19T15:05:00Z

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Task Breakdown**: Decompose complex requirements into actionable steps
2. **Strategy Design**: Create implementation roadmaps and phased approaches
3. **Requirement Analysis**: Clarify specifications and identify dependencies
4. **Architecture Planning**: Design system improvements and integration approaches
5. **Resource Planning**: Estimate timelines, complexity, and coordination needs

## Tim-Combo Planning Patterns

### Integration Implementation Planning ✅
```markdown
## Integration Planning Template

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] API documentation analysis
- [ ] Authentication flow mapping
- [ ] Data structure identification
- [ ] Field mapping requirements

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (3-4 weeks)
- [ ] Authentication handler creation
- [ ] Data extraction handlers
- [ ] Transformation engine integration
- [ ] Frontend wizard development

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Unit test implementation
- [ ] Integration test scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Performance validation
```

### Feature Development Planning ✅
```markdown
## Feature Planning Framework

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **User Stories**: Who needs what and why
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
- **Edge Cases**: Error scenarios and boundaries
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, scalability

### 2. Technical Design
- **Database Changes**: Schema updates, migrations
- **API Design**: Endpoints, request/response formats
- **Frontend Components**: UI/UX requirements
- **Integration Points**: Third-party services, existing systems

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- **Phase Breakdown**: Incremental delivery approach
- **Dependencies**: Blocking relationships
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and business risks
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, e2e testing
```

## Project Planning Methodologies

### 1. Tim-Combo Development Phases
```markdown
**Phase 1: Foundation** (25% effort)
- Database schema design
- Core API endpoints
- Basic frontend scaffolding
- Authentication integration

**Phase 2: Core Features** (50% effort)
- Business logic implementation
- Data transformation pipeline
- User interface development
- Integration testing

**Phase 3: Polish & Production** (25% effort)
- Error handling refinement
- Performance optimization
- User experience improvements
- Deployment preparation
```

### 2. Risk Assessment Framework
```markdown
**Technical Risks**
- API rate limiting and reliability
- Data transformation complexity
- Authentication/security requirements
- Performance and scalability concerns

**Business Risks**
- Client onboarding complexity
- Competitive feature parity
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Market timing considerations

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Prototype complex transformations early
- Build authentication sandbox first
- Performance test with realistic data volumes
- Client feedback loops throughout development
```

## Architecture Planning

### 1. System Enhancement Planning
```markdown
## Pipeline Transformation System Plan

### Current State Analysis
- 70% robustness with single-step transformations
- 311 handlers with method-specific architecture
- Expression Engine with 50+ functions deployed

### Target State Vision
- 95%+ robustness with multi-step pipelines
- Error recovery with partial success handling
- Intelligent caching and performance optimization

### Implementation Phases
1. **Pipeline Engine** - Core multi-step transformation capability
2. **Error Recovery** - Graceful degradation and partial success
3. **Performance Layer** - Caching and optimization
4. **Intelligence** - Auto-mapping and schema adaptation
```

### 2. Integration Expansion Planning
```markdown
## POS Integration Roadmap

### Completed ✅
- **Clover POS**: Production-ready with 11 handlers, 5-step wizard
- **TimeBridge**: Established pattern for complex integrations

### Next Priorities
1. **Square POS** (Q1) - 4M+ merchants, similar API patterns
2. **Toast POS** (Q2) - Restaurant focus, premium segment
3. **Shopify POS** (Q3) - E-commerce + retail hybrid

### Resource Requirements
- 90-150 days development per integration
- Reuse 70-80% of existing architecture
- Focus on differentiated features per platform
```

## Task Coordination

### 1. Agent Coordination Patterns
```markdown
## Multi-Agent Project Structure

**Planner Role**:
- Define project phases and milestones
- Identify task dependencies and sequencing
- Coordinate between coder, tester, reviewer agents
- Monitor progress and adjust plans

**Handoff Protocols**:
- Planner → Researcher: Context gathering requirements
- Planner → Coder: Detailed implementation specs
- Planner → Tester: Test scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Planner → Reviewer: Quality gates and review checkpoints
```

### 2. Progress Tracking
```markdown
## Milestone Tracking Template

### Sprint Planning (2-week cycles)
- [ ] Sprint goal definition
- [ ] Task estimation and assignment
- [ ] Dependency identification
- [ ] Risk assessment update

### Daily Coordination
- Progress against milestones
- Blocker identification and resolution
- Resource reallocation needs
- Quality gate status

### Sprint Review
- Deliverable demonstration
- Stakeholder feedback integration
- Next sprint planning
- Process improvement identification
```
