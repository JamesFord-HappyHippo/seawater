# üîç CLARIFICATION: What Paths Did We Actually Change?

## **üéØ The Real Issue**

The conflict wasn't between two different functions using the same path. The issue was that **`processEventsFunction` had TWO events** using conflicting paths:

## **üìã What We Found & Fixed**

### **Before Fix: `processEventsFunction` had DUPLICATE events**
```yaml
processEventsFunction:
  Events:
    processEventsEvent:
      Path: /tim/integrations/events/process  # ‚úÖ CORRECT
      Method: POST
    ManualBatchProcessingEvent:
      Path: /tim/integrations/batch/process   # üö® CONFLICTED with scheduledBatchProcessorFunction
      Method: POST
```

### **And `scheduledBatchProcessorFunction` also had:**
```yaml
scheduledBatchProcessorFunction:
  Events:
    ManualBatchProcessingEvent:
      Path: /tim/integrations/batch/process   # üö® SAME PATH = CONFLICT
      Method: POST
```

## **‚úÖ What We Fixed**

### **REMOVED the duplicate event from `processEventsFunction`:**
```yaml
processEventsFunction:
  Events:
    processEventsEvent:
      Path: /tim/integrations/events/process  # ‚úÖ KEPT THIS ONE
      Method: POST
    # REMOVED ManualBatchProcessingEvent - it was duplicate/wrong
```

### **KEPT `scheduledBatchProcessorFunction` unchanged:**
```yaml
scheduledBatchProcessorFunction:
  Events:
    ManualBatchProcessingEvent:
      Path: /tim/integrations/batch/process   # ‚úÖ CORRECT HOME FOR THIS
      Method: POST
```

## **üéØ Summary**

**We didn't change any primary function paths.** We just:
- ‚úÖ **Removed a duplicate/wrong event** from `processEventsFunction`
- ‚úÖ **Left all correct paths unchanged**

### **Final Clean Result:**
- **`processEventsFunction`**: `/tim/integrations/events/process` ‚úÖ
- **`scheduledBatchProcessorFunction`**: `/tim/integrations/batch/process` ‚úÖ
- **No conflicts** ‚úÖ

**The paths are now correctly separated as they should have been originally!**
