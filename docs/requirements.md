Designing a Climate‑Risk Resource Page for Seawater.io
Why climate risk matters for home buyers and movers
Climate disasters are becoming more frequent and more costly. U.S. government data show that there were 24 confirmed climate‑related disasters causing at least US$1 billion in damages in 2024, with hurricanes, severe storms and wildfires accounting for most of the events
realestate.usnews.com
. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that the average number of “billion‑dollar” weather disasters in the United States rose from 3.3 in 1980 to 22.5 per year between 2020‑2024
realestate.usnews.com
. The record‑breaking 2024 hurricane and storm season and destructive wildfires in early 2025 underscore that climate risks are increasing

.

Climate risks affect property values and insurance costs. Housing researchers note that climate‑risk information can change buyer behavior; when Redfin displayed flood‑risk scores from the First Street Foundation, users adjusted their searches toward less flood‑prone properties and were more likely to bid on homes with lower flood risks. Insurers are also reacting—programs like FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program have underpriced risk for years, leaving them billions of dollars in debt. New risk‑rating systems will align premiums more closely with a property’s actual risk, and some insurers are withdrawing from high‑risk states, making it harder or more expensive to obtain coverage.

Home buyers need accessible risk information. Historically, climate‑risk data was hard to find, but real‑estate portals now integrate scores for flood, wildfire, heat and other hazards. Forbes notes that sites like Redfin provide climate risk scores from the First Street Foundation that allow buyers to see whether a home faces flooding, wildfire, extreme heat or wind risk

Additional considerations for home buyers and movers
Insurance costs and availability. FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 is gradually aligning flood‑insurance premiums with individual property risk, which means buyers should anticipate higher premiums for high‑risk properties. Some insurers, including State Farm and Allstate, have stopped writing new homeowner policies in parts of California and other states because of wildfire risk. Home buyers should consult insurance agents early and budget for rising premiums and deductibles
forbes.com
.

Building codes and retrofits. Only 32 percent of jurisdictions tracked by FEMA’s BCAT had adopted the most current hazard‑resistant building codes as of mid‑2024
realestate.usnews.com
. Because adoption and enforcement vary, buyers should confirm what codes were in force when a home was built or renovated and consider retrofits (e.g., hurricane straps, fire‑resistant roofs). InspectToProtect.org provides suggested upgrades based on location
realestate.usnews.com
.

Disclosure laws differ by state. The Lincoln Institute reports that 23 states do not require sellers to disclose flood‑risk information and fire‑risk disclosure may only apply in state‑managed wildfire zones. Buyers should ask sellers about past flooding, wildfire events, insurance claims and existing mitigation measures
realestate.usnews.com
.

Prepare for multiple hazards. Even “climate havens” can face extreme heat, wildfire smoke or inland flooding. Earth911 notes that FEMA’s National Risk Index and other tools cover 18 different hazards
earth911.com
; Augurisk includes societal risks like air pollution

. Buyers should examine the full risk profile, not just one hazard.

Recommendations for Seawater.io’s climate‑risk page
1. Integrate easy‑to‑understand risk scores
Use publicly available data to display hazard scores by location. Incorporate FEMA’s National Risk Index and flood maps for baseline hazard and social vulnerability scores. For more granular data, offer optional links or API integrations with First Street’s RiskFactor or ClimateCheck so users can obtain property‑level flood, wildfire and heat scores.

Provide context and caveats. Explain that different models may yield different scores, as Earth911 observes that RiskFactor tends to give higher hazard ratings than FEMA or Augurisk
earth911.com
. Encourage users to compare multiple sources and consult professionals.

2. Offer building‑code and resilience information
Display local building‑code status. Use FEMA’s BCAT data to show whether a jurisdiction has adopted modern wind/hurricane/seismic codes
realestate.usnews.com
. Provide links to InspectToProtect.org where users can verify the code for a specific address and find recommended retrofits
realestate.usnews.com
.

Highlight retrofitting guides. Link to FEMA’s mitigation guidance and Ready.gov checklists so users know how to strengthen a home against common hazards
earth911.com
.

3. Educate about insurance and disclosure
Explain flood insurance requirements and costs. Describe how flood insurance may be mandatory for federally backed mortgages if a property lies in a FEMA high‑risk floodplain, and note average premiums and the potential for rate increases under Risk Rating 2.0. Include tips on asking sellers for current premiums and understanding “lender‑placed” insurance, which can be more costly
realestate.usnews.com
.

Summarize state disclosure rules. Provide an interactive map or table indicating whether states require flood or wildfire risk disclosures, with notes on when disclosures occur. Encourage buyers to ask sellers for hazard histories and mitigation measures
realestate.usnews.com
.

4. Support informed decision‑making
Create a checklist for buyers. Include questions such as: What is the home’s current insurance premium? Is it in a FEMA flood zone? How have hazards changed in recent years? What resilience upgrades have been made?
realestate.usnews.com

Promote climate‑savvy agents and professionals. Explain how to find real‑estate agents knowledgeable about climate risks (interview them about their certifications and experience) and suggest consulting insurance agents and home inspectors early
realestate.usnews.com
.

5. Plan for the future
Update data regularly. Climate models and hazard maps evolve. The site should refresh risk scores when FEMA updates its NRI, when new insurance rules are adopted or when private providers release new forecasts.

Provide news and insights. Offer blog posts summarizing major climate‑related housing news—e.g., updates to building codes, insurance market changes, or notable disasters. ClimateCheck’s blog posts show how lenders are increasingly required to assess physical climate risk and how major disasters can alter insurance and lending practices

Conclusion
Climate change is reshaping the housing market. More frequent and intense disasters mean buyers must evaluate flood, wildfire, heat and other risks alongside traditional factors like schools or commute times. Evidence shows that providing clear risk information influences buyer behavior and that insurance markets are starting to price those risks accurately. A well‑designed climate‑risk page on Seawater.io can equip home buyers and movers with the data, context and resources they need to make informed decisions and protect their investments.
