# Technology Stack and Security Standards

## AWS Services and Infrastructure

### AWS Control Tower Governance

The development environment exists within an AWS account managed by AWS Control Tower, providing:
- **Unified Governance**: Consistent policies across all organizational accounts
- **Security Guardrails**: Preventative and detective controls enforced organization-wide

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>Cognito: Login Request
    Cognito->>Cognito: Validate Credentials
    Cognito->>Client: JWT Tokens (ID, Access, Refresh)
    Client->>API Gateway: Request + Authorization Header
    API Gateway->>Lambda Authorizer: Validate Token
    Lambda Authorizer->>API Gateway: Allow/Deny + Context
    API Gateway->>Lambda: Forward Request + Context
    Lambda->>Client: Protected Resource
```

### Authorization Model

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Super Admin: System-wide access
   - Client Admin: Client-scoped access
   - Integration Admin: Integration-scoped access
   - Company Admin: Company-scoped access
   - User: Feature-specific access

2. **Context-Based Authorization**
   - Company context required for company operations
   - Client context required for client operations
   - Integration context required for integration operations
   - Feature context required for feature operations

3. **Permission Structure**
   ```typescript
   interface Permission {
     resource: string;     // Resource identifier
     action: string;       // Action type (read, write, execute)
     scope: string;        // Scope of access (all, company, client)
     context?: string[];   // Required context fields
   }
   ```

### Data Security

1. **Data Classification**
   - Public: Publicly available information
   - Internal: Organization-only information
   - Confidential: Restricted information
   - Sensitive: Highly restricted information

2. **Encryption Requirements**
   - Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
   - Data in transit: TLS 1.2+
   - Database encryption: RDS encryption
   - File encryption: S3 server-side encryption
   - Secrets: AWS Secrets Manager

3. **PII Handling**
   - Minimize PII collection
   - Tokenization for sensitive data
   - Masking in logs and error messages
   - Audit trails for PII access
   - Retention policies for PII data

## Certificate Management

### X.509 Certificate Handling

1. **Certificate Storage**
   - Encrypted storage in S3
   - Access controlled via IAM
   - Short-lived presigned URLs for access
   - Metadata in database, content in S3

2. **Certificate Lifecycle**
   - Creation via self-service portal
   - Expiration monitoring and alerts
   - Automatic rotation capability
   - Historical tracking for audit

3. **Certificate Usage**
   - Authentication to external systems
   - Client API authentication
   - Secure communication between services
   - Identity verification

## Security Monitoring and Compliance

### Monitoring Architecture

1. **CloudWatch Logs**
   - Centralized logging
   - Log retention policy (30 days minimum)
   - Structured logging format
   - Log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

2. **CloudTrail**
   - API activity monitoring
   - Management event logging
   - Data event logging for sensitive resources
   - Multi-region trail configuration

3. **Security Alerting**

   - Resource misconfiguration alerts
   - API usage anomalies

### Compliance Requirements

1. **Audit Logging**
   - User activity logging
   - Administrative action logging

   - Authentication and authorization logging

2. **Access Reviews**
   - Regular IAM role reviews
