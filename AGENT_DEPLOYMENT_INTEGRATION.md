# Seawater Agent Deployment Orchestrator Integration

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Integration Source:** Tim-Combo AgentDeploymentOrchestrator

## 🎯 Overview

The AgentDeploymentOrchestrator completes Seawater's autonomous development capabilities by providing automated deployment for agent-generated code. This bridges the gap between code generation (AgentFactory) and production deployment.

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1. AgentDeploymentOrchestrator (`src/agents/AgentDeploymentOrchestrator.js`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates deployment of generated agents and artifacts
- **Adaptations**: Seawater-specific AWS accounts and climate platform patterns
- **Features**: Multi-stage deployment pipeline with comprehensive error handling

### 2. Agent Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy-agents.js`)
- **Purpose**: CLI interface for agent generation and deployment
- **Integration**: Connects AgentFactory with AgentDeploymentOrchestrator
- **Modes**: Full, dev, generate-only, deploy-only

### 3. NPM Scripts (Updated `package.json`)
```bash
npm run deploy-agents          # Full generation and deployment
npm run deploy-agents:dev      # Quick dev deployment
npm run deploy-agents:generate # Generate agents only
npm run deploy-agents:deploy   # Deploy existing artifacts
```

## 🌊 Seawater-Specific Adaptations

### AWS Account Configuration
```javascript
awsProfiles: {
  dev: 'dev-sso',      // Account: 532595801838
  media: 'media-sso'   // Account: 855652006097
}

buckets: {
  lambda: 'seawater-dev-lambda-532595801838',
  frontend: 'seawater-dev-fe-live-855652006097',
  media: 'seawater-media-live-855652006097'
}
```

### Climate Platform Features
- **Multi-region coordination** for global climate data
- **Mobile app integration** with Flutter build pipeline
- **Real-time monitoring** deployment patterns
- **Climate data processing** infrastructure automation

### Deployment Stages
1. **Climate Infrastructure** - SAM template deployment
2. **Lambda Handlers** - Climate data processors and API endpoints
3. **Frontend Components** - React components with climate UI
4. **Mobile Application** - Flutter app build and validation
5. **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing pipeline

## 📱 Mobile Integration

The orchestrator includes Flutter-specific deployment capabilities:

```javascript
async deployMobile(mobileFiles) {
  // Flutter analysis and testing
  execSync('flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos');
  execSync('flutter test');
  
  // Build mobile artifacts
  execSync('flutter build apk --debug');
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Full Deployment Pipeline
```bash
npm run deploy-agents
```
Generates comprehensive climate platform agents and deploys:
- Risk assessment handlers
- Data integration processors  
- Mobile app components
- Real-time monitoring systems

### Development Iteration
```bash
npm run deploy-agents:dev
```
Quick deployment for development changes:
- Minimal agent generation
- Fast handler deployment
- Frontend component updates

### Generation Only
```bash
npm run deploy-agents:generate
```
Generate agents without deployment:
- Code generation testing
- Artifact inspection
- Development planning

## 🔍 Quality Assurance Integration

The orchestrator includes comprehensive testing:

```javascript
async runTests(tests) {
  // Jest unit tests
  execSync('npm test -- --passWithNoTests');
  
  // Playwright E2E tests
  execSync('npx playwright test --reporter=line');
  
  // Flutter mobile tests
  execSync('flutter test');
}
```

## 🌍 Climate Data Processing

Special handling for climate platform requirements:

```javascript
async deployClimateInfrastructure(artifacts) {
  // SAM infrastructure deployment
  execSync('sam build');
  execSync('sam deploy --profile dev-sso');
  
  // Climate data processor validation
  // Multi-region coordination setup
}
```

## 📊 Deployment Monitoring

The orchestrator provides detailed deployment feedback:
