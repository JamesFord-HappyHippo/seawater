## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Database Optimization

#### RDS Right-Sizing and Reserved Instances

```yaml
Current Approach:
  Development: db.t3.micro (on-demand)
  Test: db.t3.small (on-demand) 
  Staging: db.t3.medium (on-demand)
  Production: db.r6g.large + 2 replicas (on-demand)

Optimized Approach:
  Development: 
    Instance: db.t4g.micro (ARM-based, 20% cheaper)
    Pricing: On-demand
    Savings: $3/month
    
  Test:
    Instance: db.t4g.small (ARM-based)
    Pricing: On-demand
    Savings: $6/month
    
  Staging:
    Instance: db.t4g.medium (ARM-based)
    Pricing: 1-year reserved instance (30% savings)
    Savings: $14/month
    
  Production:
    Instance: db.r6g.large (ARM-based) + 1 replica
    Pricing: 1-year reserved instances (30% savings)
    Read Replica Optimization: Reduce from 2 to 1 initially
    Savings: $135/month (30% RI) + $150 (fewer replicas) = $285/month

Total Database Savings: $308/month (32% reduction)
```

#### Database Storage Optimization

```yaml
Current Storage Strategy:
  - All environments use General Purpose SSD (gp3)
  - Fixed storage allocation
  - 30-day backup retention for all

Optimized Storage Strategy:
  Development/Test:
    Storage Type: gp3 with baseline performance
    Backup Retention: 7 days (vs 14-30 days)
    Automated Snapshots: Only during business hours
    Savings: $10/month
    
  Staging:
    Storage Type: gp3 optimized
    Backup Retention: 14 days
    Point-in-time Recovery: Disabled (use manual snapshots)
    Savings: $8/month
    
  Production:
    Storage Type: gp3 with provisioned IOPS only when needed
    Backup Retention: 30 days (unchanged for compliance)
    Cross-region backup: Every 24 hours (vs real-time)
    Savings: $25/month

Total Storage Savings: $43/month
```

### 2. Lambda Function Optimization

#### Memory and Timeout Optimization

```yaml
Current Lambda Configuration:
  Memory: 1024MB-2048MB across all functions
  Timeout: 30-60 seconds
  Architecture: x86_64

Optimized Lambda Configuration:
  Architecture: ARM64 (Graviton2 - 20% price/performance improvement)
  
  Property Risk Assessment:
    Current: 2048MB, 60s timeout
    Optimized: 1536MB, 45s timeout
    Reason: Analysis shows 95th percentile execution < 30s
    Savings: 25% memory + 25% duration = 44% cost reduction
    
  Location Services:
    Current: 1024MB, 30s timeout
    Optimized: 768MB, 20s timeout
    Reason: Geocoding APIs typically respond < 5s
    Savings: 25% memory + 33% duration = 50% cost reduction
    
  Climate Data Aggregator:
    Current: 2048MB, 60s timeout
    Optimized: 1024MB, 45s timeout
    Reason: Parallel API calls, not memory intensive
    Savings: 50% memory + 25% duration = 63% cost reduction
    
  User Management:
    Current: 1024MB, 30s timeout
    Optimized: 512MB, 15s timeout
    Reason: Simple CRUD operations
    Savings: 50% memory + 50% duration = 75% cost reduction

Total Lambda Savings: $125/month (45% reduction)
```

#### Lambda Provisioned Concurrency Optimization

```yaml
Current Approach:
  All environments use on-demand Lambda execution
  Cold start times: 2-5 seconds
  
Optimized Approach:
  Production Only:
    Core Functions: 5 provisioned concurrency units
    Functions: property-risk, location-services
    Cost: $25/month
    Benefit: Eliminates cold starts for critical paths
    User Experience: Sub-second response times
    
  All Other Environments:
    Keep on-demand execution
    Use Lambda warming (CloudWatch Events every 5 minutes)
    Cost: $2/month per environment
    
Net Impact: +$31/month, but significant UX improvement
```

### 3. API Gateway Optimization

#### Request/Response Caching Strategy

```yaml
Current API Gateway Configuration:
  Caching: Disabled across all environments
  Request Validation: Basic
  
Optimized API Gateway Configuration:
  Development: No caching (rapid development)
  Test: 0.5GB cache, 5-minute TTL
  Staging: 1.6GB cache, 5-minute TTL
  Production: 6.1GB cache, 15-minute TTL
  
Cache Strategy by Endpoint:
  /climate/risk/{location}:
    TTL: 15 minutes (climate data changes slowly)
    Cache Key: location + query parameters
    Hit Ratio: Expected 70%
    
  /location/geocode:
    TTL: 24 hours (addresses don't change)
    Cache Key: address parameter
    Hit Ratio: Expected 85%
    
  /user/profile:
    TTL: 5 minutes
    Cache Key: user ID + version
    Hit Ratio: Expected 40%

Cost Impact:
  Cache Cost: $30/month
  Request Reduction: 60% average
  Lambda Invocation Savings: $85/month
  Net Savings: $55/month
```

### 4. CloudFront and CDN Optimization

  Origin Shield: Disabled
  
Optimized CloudFront Setup:
  Development: No CloudFront (direct S3)
  Test: Price Class 100 (North America + Europe)
  Staging: Price Class 200 (North America + Europe + Asia)
  Production: Price Class All (maintain global reach)
  
Cache Optimization:
  Static Assets: 1 year TTL
  API Responses: 5-minute TTL with cache keys
  Mobile App Assets: 6 months TTL
  
Origin Shield:
  Enable for production (reduces origin load)
  Cost: $10/month
  Origin Request Reduction: 40%
  
Compression:
  Enable Brotli + Gzip for all text content
  Bandwidth Savings: 20-30%
  
Total CDN Savings: $25/month
```

### 5. S3 Storage Optimization

#### Intelligent Tiering and Lifecycle Policies

```yaml
Current S3 Strategy:
  Storage Class: Standard for all objects
  Lifecycle: Basic deletion rules
  Versioning: Enabled for production
  
Optimized S3 Strategy:

    Intelligent Tiering: Enabled (automatic cost optimization)
    Lifecycle Rules:
      - 30 days: Standard → Standard-IA
      - 90 days: Standard-IA → Glacier Instant Retrieval
      - 365 days: Glacier → Deep Archive
    
  Mobile Builds Bucket:
    Lifecycle Rules:
      - 7 days: Delete non-current versions
      - 30 days: Standard → Standard-IA
      - 90 days: Delete old builds (keep latest 10)
    
  Climate Data Cache:
    Intelligent Tiering: Enabled
    Lifecycle Rules:
      - 90 days: Standard → Glacier Instant Retrieval
      - 365 days: Delete (data can be regenerated)
      
Cross-Region Replication:
  Production: Enable for critical data only
  Cost: $15/month
  Benefit: Disaster recovery for essential assets
  
Total S3 Savings: $35/month
```

### 6. Monitoring and Observability Cost Control
